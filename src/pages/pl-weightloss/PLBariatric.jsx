            Although the benefits from weight loss surgery can be life-changing,
            insurance companies donâ€™t consistently cover the costs, which
            typically range from $15,000 to $25,000.
          </Text>
          <Text align={"text-center"} padding={`py-2`}>
            Insurance coverage may not take care of all of your costs. You may
            end up needing to cover out-of-pocket costs due to deductibles, time
            off work, and other associated expenses.

            Understanding the kinds of costs involved with weight-loss surgery
            can help you evaluate your financial situation and consider whether
            bariatric surgery financing may be right for you.
